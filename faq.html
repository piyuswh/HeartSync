        <div class="question">1. How does online dating work?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Online dating involves creating a profile on a dating website or app,
          where you can upload photos and provide information about yourself.
          You can then browse through other users' profiles and initiate
          communication with those you're interested in.

        <div class="answer">
          Safety is a priority. We implement various security measures,
          including profile verification and moderation of content. However,
          it's important to use caution and follow safety guidelines when
          meeting someone in person for the first time.

        <div class="answer">
          To make your profile stand out, upload clear, recent photos that
          showcase your personality and interests. Write a bio that reflects who
          you are and what you're looking for in a partner. Be honest and
          authentic to attract compatible matches.

        <div class="question">4. What should I talk about in messages?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Start by referencing something from the other person's profile to show
          you've read it. Ask open-ended questions to spark meaningful
          conversations. Avoid overly personal or inappropriate topics
          initially.

          Look for signs such as prompt replies to your messages, engagement in
          conversation, and enthusiasm about meeting in person. However, always
          communicate openly and directly to clarify intentions.

          Rejection is a normal part of dating. If someone isn't interested,
          respect their decision and move on. Focus on the connections that are
          mutually fulfilling and don't take rejection personally.
